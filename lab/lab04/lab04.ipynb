    "## 1. Defining functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a very simple function that converts a proportion to a percentage by multiplying it by 100.  For example, the value of `to_percentage(.5)` should be the number 50.  (No percent sign.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function definition has a few parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `def`\n",
    "It always starts with `def` (short for **def**ine):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Name\n",
    "Next comes the name of the function.  Let's call our function `to_percentage`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def to_percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Signature\n",
    "Next comes something called the *signature* of the function.  This tells Python how many arguments your function should have, and what names you'll use to refer to those arguments in the function's code.  `to_percentage` should take one argument, and we'll call that argument `proportion` since it should be a proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion)\n",
    "\n",
    "We put a colon after the signature to tell Python it's over.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Documentation\n",
    "Functions can do complicated things, so you should write an explanation of what your function does.  For small functions, this is less important, but it's a good habit to learn from the start.  Conventionally, Python functions are documented by writing a triple-quoted string:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Body\n",
    "Now we start writing code that runs when the function is called.  This is called the *body* of the function.  We can write anything we could write anywhere else.  First let's give a name to the number we multiply a proportion by to get a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `return`\n",
    "The special instruction `return` in a function's body tells Python to make the value of the function call equal to whatever comes right after `return`.  We want the value of `to_percentage(.5)` to be the proportion .5 times the factor 100, so we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def to_percentage(proportion):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Converts a proportion to a percentage.\"\"\"\n",
    "        factor = 100\n",
    "        return proportion * factor\n",
    "Note that `return` inside a function gives the function a value, while `print`, which we have used before, is a function which has no `return` value and just prints a certain value out to the console. The two are very different. "

    "Rather than getting data on every player, imagine that we had gotten data on only a smaller subset of the players.  For 492 players, it's not so unreasonable to expect to see all the data, but usually we aren't so lucky.  Instead, we often make *statistical inferences* about a large underlying population using a smaller sample.\n",

    "A statistical inference is a statement about some statistic of the underlying population, such as \"the average salary of NBA players in 2014 was $3\".  You may have heard the word \"inference\" used in other contexts.  It's important to keep in mind that statistical inferences, unlike, say, logical inferences, can be wrong.\n",

This strategy sometimes works well and sometimes doesn't.  The degree to which it gives us useful answers depends on several factors, and we'll touch lightly on a few of those today.\n",
